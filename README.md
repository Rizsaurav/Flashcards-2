# Web Development Project 2 - *Flashcards - 2*

Submitted by: **Saurav Rijal**

This web app: **The Flashcards Study App is an interactive learning tool that allows users to flip flashcards, enter answers, and track their streaks while studying. Users can shuffle cards, navigate through them, and mark learned cards as "Mastered" to focus only on what they need to review. Built with React.js, the app provides a smooth and engaging experience for efficient memorization and self-testing.**

Time spent: **5** hours spent in total
